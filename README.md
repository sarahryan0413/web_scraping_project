# Module 11 Challenge
---
For this week's challenge, we are going to Mars! I am tackling a full web-scraping and data analysis project. I will use Splinter and Beautiful Soup to extract information from HTML elements, including tables and recurring elements, while refining my skills in collecting, organizing, analyzing, and communicating data insights.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

I will scrape the Mars News website by using automated browsing to visit the site, inspect the page, and identify the elements to scrape. I'll use Beautiful Soup to extract the titles and preview text of the news articles, storing them in dictionaries with "title" and "preview" keys. These dictionaries will be collected in a list, which I'll print in the notebook.
